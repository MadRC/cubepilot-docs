# The Cube  -  Firmware Installation & Connection  Troubleshooting

## The Cube Autopilot All Models Out The Box

All Cube Autopilot models now come with no autopilot software installed from the factory and as such you will need to install your chosen firmware such as Ardupilor or PX4 before you can use it.

### Supported Ardupilot Versions

The Cube Black, Purple and Blue F4* models are compatible with older versions of Ardupilot and PX4 software however the Cube Orange, Yellow and Blue H7* models are using the STM32F7 and the STM32H7 microcontrollers that require you are using the latest drivers and software to use these models.

### Cube Blue H4 and H7 Firmware
The Cube Blue was originally based on the STM32F4 with the same main FMU specification as the Cube Black. Later Cube Blue H7 and Purple H7 versions are based on the STM32H7 and have the same FMU specification as the Cube Orange. 

When choosing Firmware the original Blue F4 based Cube should use Cube Black, for later Cube BlueH7 version you should use the Cube Orange version. 


**Note** It is strongly advised to use the latest stable release of Ardupilot at all times to ensure you are uptosdate with any bug and feature updates.

### Cube Black, Blue F4 and Purple

These Cube models are supported in older versions of Ardupilot however its strogly advised to use Arducopter 3.6.12 or Arduplane 3.9.11 or later due to a critical I2C Storm bug fixes.

More Information on this specific issue can be found in the Cubepilot bulitins or Ardupilot forum.

**Note:** The correct firmware versions for your hardware should be selected automatically by Mission Planner however if prompted to select board type do not select Linux. Select 'Pixhawk' and then select 'Cube Black'.

#### Cube Orange and Yellow Firmware

Cube Orange and Cube Yellow require Ardupilot 4.0 or later, At the time of writting Arducopter 4.0 was still in beta and you may need to click the 'Beta Firmware' option at and select the version you require.

**Note:** You may need to download the firmware manually, to do this select 'Download Firmwares ' at the bottom of the firmware downloads screen in Mission Planner and download the relivent versions from the daily build or beta secition of the Ardupilot downloads area for your application. Then use the 'Load custom firmware' option to install the file you have dowloaded.

## USB Connection Issues

Most issues related to conneting to the Cube are caused by the following

* Old version of Mission Planner/Ground Station
* Old drivers
* Older Windows OS such as Windows 7 \(Windows 10 Recommended\) 

First steps to resolve connections issues is to update Mission Planner and drivers as shown above.

When correctly installed with Ardupilot loaded Mission Planner should show the Cube listed with its port unter the top connection box, the actual com port number my vary but it should show as follows

**Cube Black**

![Cube Black Mission Planner Com Port](../.gitbook/assets/cube-black-mp-com-port.jpg)

1. To connect Cube Black select the port and set the baud rate 57600 and click connect. 

**Cube Orange & Cube Yellow**

![Cube Orange Com Ports In Mission Planner](../.gitbook/assets/cube-orange-mp-com-ports.jpg)

1. To connect Cube Orange or Yellow select the Mavlink com port and set the baud rate 57600 and click connect. 

### Com Ports In Device Manager

If you are still having connection issues you can check if the com ports are correctly installed by going to device manager in Windows.

Cube Black, Purple and Blue should show a single com port as follows

![Cube Black Com Ports in Device Manager ](../.gitbook/assets/cube-black-device-manager-port.jpg)

Cube Orange and Yellow should show two com ports connected 'Cube Orange Mavlink \(COMx\) and Cube Orange SLCAN \(COMx\)'

![Cube Orange Com Ports in Device Manager ](../.gitbook/assets/cube-orange-device-manager-ports.jpg)

For Cube Orange and Yellow if you see 'ProfiCNC CUBE H7 \(COMx\)' or ' ProfiCNC CUBE F7 \(COMx\)' then the drivers are not installed correctly and follow the above process again.

### Cube Orange & Yellow - Windows 7

There are known issues installing the Cube Orange and Cube Yellow with Windows 7. Its advised you use Windowns 10 or later however Windows 7 can be made to work in some circumstances by manually deleting the driver files and installing the latest driver file and forcing Windows to install the correct driver manually.

1. Delete ProfiCNC CUBE H7/F7 from device manager while the Cube is still connected, then disconnect the Cube from USB.
2. Uninstall and reinstall the latest Cube drivers as linked above.
3. Reconnect the Cube Orange/Yellow and two devices will show up in “Other Devices” called CubeOrange-BL. 
4. The top entry will change to CubeOrange and you should see the message from windows notifying you that it is installing device drivers.
5. CubeOrange-BL will move to the Ports section and be named Cube Orange Mavlink \(COMx\)
6. If the “CubeOrange-BL” in Other Devices" does not move to Ports after a few moments, right click, go into properties, click on the driver button and wait, it should then move to Ports and is named Cube Orange SLCAN \(COMx\).
